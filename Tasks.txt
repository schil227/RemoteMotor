TODOs:
- (5/1/21) Construct actual arena (include rubber bands to keep robot arm in place)
- (5/1/21) Enable SSL

In Progress:
    - (5/30/21) Diagnose why server is unreachable occasionally

DONE:
- (5/1/21 - 5/2/21) Make it so if the server hasn't been "locked", it doesn't change the users input on the frontend (e.g. AcceptingInput->Warning->AcceptingInput... shouldn't change users current input.)
- (5/1/21- 5/2/21) Fix stream display size on UI
    -Fixed resolution, still a bit laggy
- (5/1/21 - 5/6/21) Get faster webcams
    -Fixed by changing the preset to `ultrafast`, tweaking `-g 10`, and adding the `-tune zerolatency` setting to the libx264 codec.
    -Decreased latency on the frontend from 3 to 1.5 seconds, some cams better than others
- (5/7/21 - 5/10/21) minimize stream whitespace, make sure it looks good on mobile
- (5/2/21 - 5/10/21) Enhance site with sections (e.g. "stream", "input") and update warning message/lock message near section ("awiating input", "robot about to move...", "robot moving..."), scroll back to the "stream" section after engage button press.
- (5/2/21 - 5/12/21) Write out metrics for who joins and for how long, based on user id.
- (5/13/21 - 5/14/21) Add "command sent!" feedback on button press
- (5/1/21 - 5/17/21) Stress Test (ask Josh?)
    -Basically, best odds are to host the app on a hosted service that has load balancing. See ReadMe (## Server Hosting)
- (5/17/21 - 5/20/21) Add an info ? next to the "number of commanders" piece
- (5/17/21 - 5/20/21) Add collapsable sections that explain what it is and the objective 
- (5/20/21 - 5/25/21) Notify the frontend on goal
- (5/23/21 - 5/26/21) (Bug) when submitting a command, should only send when the control has changed (not working?)
- (5/26/21 - 5/26/21) (Bug) values of 0 are being counted against final aggregate command - ignore these.
- (5/26/21 - 5/29/21) verify that only 1 command can be sent per user (use phone on real session)
    This was an interesting one; the core problem was that cookies were not being set. While it worked 'originally', it inadvertantly stopped working 
    once the site was AName redirected to robotarm.io (as opposed to the raw IP address). The reason the cookie wasn't being set was because the domain
    between the frontend (robotarm.io) and webapi (96.42...) were incongruent, and the SameSite policy of the cookie disallowed for non-same sites.
    The solution was to change the webapi target ip from 96.42... to robotarm.io, thus setting the source domains to the same value, and allowing cookies
    to go though.
- (5/23/21 - 5/30/21 Frontend should do something on goal

STALLED:
- (5/1/21) Enable Ads (https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
    -> Partially done, however due to 'Lack of Content' advertisment was rejected. Need to add more information on the page, about page, etc.

DISCARDED:
- (5/13/21) resize input divs depending on screensize, similar to how streams are managed
    -Honestly, it's fine. Would be nice to shink the modules, but it's fine.
